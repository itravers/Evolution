Evolution

I aim to create creatures in a simulated world.
These creatures will have brains.
These creatures will have Sexual Reproduction.
These creates will have A-Sexual Reproduction.
These creates brains will evolve using a genetic algorithm.
The evolution of the brains will cause the creatures to become more fit.
We will be able to save the brains of these creature for future use.
